0,What was the main legal issue in the appeal case of Nand Singh and his sons concerning the allotment of land in the village Raikot?,The main legal issue in the appeal case was whether the Deputy Custodian General had the jurisdiction to revise the order canceling the allotment of land in Raikot made in favor of the appellants after the enactment of the 1954 Act and the notification issued thereunder.,"The main legal issue in the appeal case of Nand Singh and his sons concerning the allotment of land in the village Raikot was the rejection of their application for consolidation of lands with the appellants in the village Raikot by the Assistant Custodian on the ground that no land was available in the village. This decision led to a series of appeals and revisions, ultimately resulting in the appellants filing a revision application before the Custodian General on October 7, 1952."
1,"On what grounds did the Deputy Custodian General dismiss the appellants' application in the judgment dated November 8, 1957?","The Deputy Custodian General dismissed the appellants' application on the grounds that his jurisdiction to revise the order had been taken away by the provisions of the 1954 Act and the notification issued on March 24, 1955. The decision relied on the precedent set in the case of Bal Mukund vs. The State of Punjab.","The Deputy Custodian General dismissed the appellants' application on the grounds that his jurisdiction to revise the order had been taken away by the provisions of (44 of 1954) and the notification issued thereunder on March 24, 1955. He relied on the decision in Bal Mukund vs The State of Punjab (1), where it was held that the powers of the Custodian General to deal with such matters had been transferred to another authority, and there was no provision for continuing proceedings that had been initiated but not concluded under the previous jurisdiction."
2,What was the main legal issue concerning the timing of when property in the goods passed in the context of the sales on FOB contracts in this case?," The main legal issue was whether the property in the goods passed to the buyers at the time of shipment (i.e., after crossing the customs frontier) or at some point before shipment. The sellers argued that the property passed on shipment, thus exempting them from sales tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution. The court had to determine if the sales occurred ""in the course of export"" and if the goods were indeed exempt from sales tax based on the timing of the property transfer.","The main legal issue concerning the timing of when property in the goods passed in the context of the sales on FOB contracts in this case was whether the property passed on shipment of the goods or at a different time as agreed upon by the parties. The question revolved around whether the property in the goods passed to the buyer even before shipment, based on the specific circumstances of the sales contracts and the agreements made between the sellers and buyers. The key consideration was whether there was a different agreement between the parties regarding when the property in the goods would transfer, and this had to be determined by examining all the surrounding circumstances of the sales contracts."
3,How did the court interpret the provision of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act regarding the levy of purchase tax?,"he court interpreted section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act to mean that the term ""a person"" refers specifically to a registered dealer. Therefore, the purchasing dealer was liable for purchase tax if the goods were not dispatched outside the State of Bombay by a registered dealer, despite having furnished a certificate under section 8(b) of the Act. The court concluded that the legislative intent was to ensure that the actual despatch outside the state was carried out by a registered dealer to comply with the provisions and that failing to do so justified the levy of purchase tax.","The court interpreted the provision of section 10(b) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act to mean that no purchase tax was leviable on the appellants. They concluded that the sales were exempted from tax under article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution, as the goods remained the sellers' property until they had been brought and loaded on board the ship. This exemption from tax was based on the specific conditions outlined in section 9(1)(b) of the Act, which the court found applicable in this case. Additionally, the court considered an alternative argument presented by the assessees' counsel and ultimately accepted it, ruling that there could be no levy of purchase tax under section 9(1) of the Act in this situation. The court also addressed the State's contention that section 9(1)(b) had been declared unconstitutional, but proceeded to consider this argument and ultimately decided in favor of the assessees based on the provisions of the Act."
4, What was the basis for the conviction of Ram Singh in the case discussed?,"Ram Singh was convicted of the murder of Sheo Sahai based on several pieces of evidence. The prosecution presented evidence of motive, including a prior dispute between the appellant and the victim, and established that Ram Singh purchased a sword, which was later found stained with human blood. Additionally, Ram Singh made an extra-judicial confession to Ujagar Singh, admitting to the crime. Despite the High Court initially rejecting this confession, the Supreme Court found that the evidence, including the sword's condition and Ram Singh's actions, sufficiently supported his conviction for murder under Section 302, I.P.C.","The basis for the conviction of Ram Singh in the case discussed was that he caused injuries to Sheo Sahai, who later died of the injuries received. Ram Singh attacked Sheo Sahai while he was sleeping in his cattle shed in village Bhadurpur Ghar with a sword, leading to his death. This act of violence resulted in Ram Singh being convicted and sentenced to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code."
5,Why did the Supreme Court find it unnecessary to decide on the admissibility of the portions of the report dictated by Ram Singh at the Police Station?," The Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide on the admissibility of the portions of the report dictated by Ram Singh at the Police Station because there was substantial independent evidence to support the conviction. This included testimony about the motive, the purchase of the sword, and the sword being stained with human blood. The Court concluded that the independent evidence was sufficient to establish Ram Singh's guilt, making it unnecessary to determine whether the dictated report was admissible as evidence.",The Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide on the admissibility of the portions of the report dictated by Ram Singh at the Police Station because there was good independent evidence with respect to the four matters mentioned in the report and relied on by the High Court in considering the case against the appellant.
6,"What was the primary contention of the appellant regarding the termination of Sankaran's employment, and how did the Court address this contention?","The primary contention of the appellant was that under Rule 18(a) of the Standing Orders, they were entitled to terminate the services of any employee by providing 14 days' notice or paying 12 days' wages without needing to justify the termination. The appellant argued that this rule allowed them to dispense with Sankaran's services without the need for a departmental inquiry. The Court, however, rejected this contention, stating that the right to terminate employment under Rule 18(a) was not absolute and could not be used in a manner that negates the security of service provided to industrial employees through industrial adjudication. The Court held that even if termination was executed under Rule 18(a), it was subject to scrutiny by the industrial tribunal to ensure that the action was bona fide and not a colourable exercise of powe","The primary contention of the appellant regarding the termination of Sankaran's employment was that holding a departmental inquiry would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees in general, and that the maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would be prejudiced if Sankaran was retained in their service. The appellant considered that no inquiry should be held due to these reasons.

The Court addressed this contention by noting that the appellant had not provided any evidence to support their claim that holding a departmental inquiry would lead to further friction and deterioration in the rank and file of the employees. The Court also pointed out that the maintenance of discipline in the undertaking would not be prejudiced by conducting a fair inquiry into the allegations against Sankaran. Additionally, the Court emphasized that it is essential to follow proper procedures and provide an opportunity for the employee to defend themselves before terminating their employment. Therefore, the Court concluded that the termination of Sankaran's employment without conducting a departmental inquiry was unjustified."
7,"What were the reasons provided by the tribunal for setting aside the appellant's termination order, and how did the Supreme Court view these reasons?","The tribunal set aside the termination order on the grounds that the appellant's action was a colourable exercise of power under Rule 18(a). The tribunal found that while the appellant initially intended to take disciplinary action against Sankaran for alleged misconduct, it later abandoned this course and used Rule 18(a) to terminate Sankaran's services without conducting a departmental inquiry. The tribunal also noted that important witnesses who could have corroborated the alleged misconduct were not presented. The Supreme Court upheld the tribunal’s decision, agreeing that the exercise of power under Rule 18(a) was not bona fide and was intended to avoid the procedural requirements of a disciplinary inquiry. The Court emphasized that the industrial tribunal had the jurisdiction to scrutinize the action taken under Rule 18(a) and ensure it was not a result of unfair labour practices or victimization.","The reasons provided by the tribunal for setting aside the appellant's termination order were that the termination was a colourable exercise of power, a result of victimization, or unfair labor practice. The tribunal also stated that the termination was capricious, arbitrary, and unnecessarily harsh, which could be evidence of victimization or unfair labor practice.

The Supreme Court viewed these reasons favorably and approved the observations made by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in previous cases such as The Chartered Bank, Bombay vs The Chartered Bank Employees' Union and Assam Oil Company vs Its Workmen. The Supreme Court agreed that in cases where the termination of service is not done in good faith, is a form of victimization, or is unfair, the industrial tribunal has the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination. The Court also agreed that termination that is capricious, arbitrary, or excessively harsh may be considered evidence of victimization or unfair labor practice."
8,What were the primary allegations against the appellant in the appeals before the Supreme Court?,"The primary allegations against the appellant were that he either stole or secreted five registered letters and fabricated three receipts to show that these letters were received by the addressees. The appellant was charged under section 52 of the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, and in two cases, also under sections 467 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code.","The primary allegations against the appellant in the appeals before the Supreme Court were that there were criminal cases against the appellant, specifically a murder case in respect of Crime No. 331 of 1985. It was mentioned that the investigation was in progress and the defense of the appellant in the murder case was that he was falsely implicated and was not at all concerned with the murder. Additionally, it was noted that at the relevant time, the appellant was undertrial in the said criminal case."
9,On what grounds did the Supreme Court decide to set aside the conviction and sentences against the appellant?,"The Supreme Court set aside the conviction and sentences on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove that the five registered letters were in the exclusive possession of the appellant. The Court found that the almirah where the letters were found was not exclusively in the appellant's possession, as the key was produced by his father, and there was no evidence to establish that the appellant had exclusive control over the almirah or the letters. Therefore, the Court concluded that the prosecution had not sufficiently proven the appellant's possession or that he had secreted the letters.","The Supreme Court decided to set aside the conviction and sentences against the appellant on the grounds that:
1. Sanction had not been obtained under section 197 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for his prosecution.
2. The evidence on record was insufficient to establish an offence under either section 465 or section 409 of the Indian Penal Code.
3. The materials on record did not justify a reversal of the acquittal verdict by the trial Magistrate."
10,What was the central issue in the appeals regarding the interpretation of Section 24B of the Income Tax Act?,"The central issue in the appeals was the interpretation of Section 24B of the Income Tax Act concerning the taxability of income received by the heirs and legal representatives of a deceased person. Specifically, the question was whether the income received by the heirs and legal representatives after the death of Amarchand N. Shroff could be deemed as income that would have been taxable if Amarchand had been alive. The Commissioner of Income Tax argued that under Section 24B, such income should be treated as if it were received by the deceased and therefore liable to tax. However, the High Court and subsequent judgments held that Section 24B did not extend to income received in the years succeeding the year in which the deceased person died.","The central issue in the appeals regarding the interpretation of Section 24B of the Income Tax Act was whether the appellant, who claimed relief under section 25(4) based on the transfer of its business to a limited company, was entitled to such relief. The question revolved around the timing and validity of the transfer, specifically whether the transfer took place on November 13, 1947, February 13, 1948, or on February 7, 1948. The Income Tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had all rejected the appellant's claim, leading to the appeals and the subsequent referral of the question to the High Court for determination."
11,What was the outcome of the appeals concerning the taxability of the income received by Amarchand N. Shroff’s heirs after his death?,"The outcome of the appeals was that the income received by Amarchand N. Shroff’s heirs after his death was not taxable under Section 24B of the Income Tax Act. The High Court concluded that Section 24B did not apply to income received after the death of the individual but was limited to income received during the previous year in which the deceased had died. Therefore, the appeals were dismissed, and it was ruled that the amounts received after Amarchand's death could not be deemed as taxable income in his hands or in the hands of his legal representatives.","The outcome of the appeals concerning the taxability of the income received by Amarchand N. Shroff's heirs after his death was that the High Court answered the question in the negative. The court held that apart from section 24E of the Income tax Act, the amounts were not taxable and that the section had no application to the case. The Appellate Tribunal also agreed that the amounts were not the income of the Hindu undivided family but merely represented inheritance or realizations of the assets of Amarchand. The Revenue did not pursue the matter further, but later proceedings were started by the Income tax Officer under section 34 in respect of the same income in the hands of ""Amarchand N. Shroff by his heirs and legal representatives."""
12,"What was the main issue that the Supreme Court needed to decide in Appeal No. 251 of 1963 regarding the definition of ""wages"" under section 2(vi) of the Act?","The main issue was whether the term ""wages"" as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act included wages fixed by an industrial award before the amendment of the definition in 1958. Specifically, the Court needed to determine if wages prescribed by an industrial tribunal's award were considered part of the definition of ""wages"" under the unamended section 2(vi) of the Act.","The main issue that the Supreme Court needed to decide in Appeal No. 251 of 1963 was whether the term ""wages"" as defined by section 2(vi) of the Act includes wages fixed by an award in an industrial dispute between the employer and his employees. The question revolved around interpreting the definition of ""wages"" as provided in section 2(vi) before it was amended in 1958, and determining whether remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court should be included in the main definition under section 2(vi). The appellant argued that in order for the wages prescribed by the award to fall under section 2(vi), it must be shown that they constitute part of the terms of the contract of employment, either express or implied."
13,"How did the Supreme Court interpret the impact of an industrial award on the definition of ""wages"" before and after the 1958 amendment to section 2(vi) of the Act?","The Supreme Court interpreted that the wages prescribed by an industrial award were included within the definition of ""wages"" under section 2(vi) of the Act even before the 1958 amendment. The Court held that the unamended definition of wages could encompass remuneration fixed by an industrial award, as industrial adjudication effectively alters the terms of employment to include such wages. The 1958 amendment was seen as a clarification rather than a change, affirming that the definition of wages already covered wages set by awards.","The Supreme Court interpreted that industrial awards supplant contractual terms in respect of matters covered by them and are substituted for them. Before the 1958 amendment to section 2(vi) of the Act, the Court found it difficult to argue that the wages prescribed by the award could not be treated as wages under the Act. However, after the 1958 amendment, it was clarified that any remuneration payable under any award or settlement between the parties or order of a Court would be included in the definition of ""wages"" under section 2(vi)."
14,"What was the dispute in Appeal No. 513 of 1963 regarding the age of retirement for employees, and how did the Supreme Court resolve it?","The dispute was about whether the age of compulsory retirement for employees of Shaw Wallace & Co. should be fixed at 58 or 60 years. The company had been retiring employees at 55 but extended the retirement age to 58 for Calcutta employees in an agreement, while the Bombay employees sought to have the retirement age fixed at 60. The Maharashtra Industrial Tribunal had initially directed that the retirement age should be 58, with discretion to extend it beyond 58. The Supreme Court resolved the issue by setting the retirement age at 60, based on the trend in the Bombay region and broader industry practice, as well as evidence from previous decisions and reports.","The dispute in Appeal No. 513 of 1963 was regarding the age of retirement for employees belonging to Class III and Class IV who entered the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956. These employees demanded that their age of retirement should be fixed at 60 years, similar to Class III and Class IV employees who were transferred from the service of the erstwhile insurers. The dispute ultimately ended in a settlement which was incorporated in the Memorandum of Settlement dated 29th January, 1965. The settlement stated that the age of retirement for Class III and Class IV employees who entered the service of the Corporation on or after 1st September, 1956 would be fixed at 60 years. The Supreme Court resolved the dispute by upholding the settlement and confirming the age of retirement for these employees at 60 years."
15,How did the Supreme Court justify its decision to fix the retirement age at 60 despite the Tribunal's initial decision?,"The Supreme Court justified its decision by emphasizing the consistent trend in the Bombay region to set the retirement age at 60, supported by evidence from various documents and previous judicial pronouncements. The Court noted that the Tribunal's findings did not convincingly disprove this trend and that the Tribunal had not provided sufficient reasons to challenge the established judicial opinion on the matter. Additionally, the Court considered reports from Committees and Commissions, which also recommended a retirement age of 60, reinforcing the Court's decision to modify the Tribunal's award.","The Supreme Court justified its decision to fix the retirement age at 60 by taking into account the trend in recent times in various concerns in the Bombay region. The Court noted that the Tribunal had found that in all the awards in recent times, the trend had been to fix the age of retirement at 60 years. This finding was a significant factor in the Court's decision not to disturb the award fixing the retirement age at 60 years. The correctness of the Tribunal's finding regarding the trend in retirement age in the Bombay region was not challenged before the Court, and the respondent company's attempt to show otherwise was based on information received from member concerns of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, which was not considered sufficient to overturn the established trend."
16,What was the primary issue being addressed in this appeal?,"The primary issue was whether the sum of Rs. 36,396 received by the assessee as an allowance during the previous year of the assessment year 1949-50 was considered revenue income liable to tax under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, or whether it was exempt from tax as agricultural income.",The primary issue being addressed in this appeal was whether the learned trial judge's decision on the facts was erroneous and so manifestly erroneous that an appellate court ought to set it aside.
17,What was the Court's conclusion regarding the nature of the allowance received by the assessee?,"The Court concluded that the allowance received by the assessee was revenue income and not exempt from taxation as agricultural income. The Court held that the source of the allowance was the arrangement made in 1837 and not land or land revenue, and thus, the income was taxable under the Act.","The Court concluded that the allowance received by the assessee was not incurred in the course of the money lending business, nor in respect of any other business of the assessee. The monies sent by the assessee to the Bombay firm were determined not to be loans made in the ordinary course of its money lending business. This finding led to the Court's decision to reject the appeal and dismiss it in favor of the Department."
18,"What was the main issue in the appeals concerning the election to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, and how did the court interpret the term ""Saha"" in relation to the Scheduled Caste specification?","The main issue in the appeals was whether Abhoy Pada Saha, who had been elected to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, was validly elected given the contestation over his caste status. Sudhir Kumar Mondal challenged the election on the grounds that Abhoy Pada Saha did not belong to a Scheduled Caste. Specifically, the term ""Saha"" in the Scheduled Castes specification was critical. The court had to determine whether ""Saha"" referred to a separate caste group within the Sunri caste or a sub-caste that was excluded from the Scheduled Caste status. The court ultimately interpreted ""Saha"" as referring to a caste group distinct from the Sunri caste, not merely a surname or sub-caste. Thus, ""Saha"" was seen as a separate caste group excluded from the Scheduled Caste list, leading to the conclusion that Abhoy Pada Saha was a Sunri by caste and should be considered part of the Scheduled Caste under the specification.","The main issue in the appeals concerning the election to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly was whether the appellant, Abhoy Pada Saha, belonged to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40. The court interpreted the term ""Saha"" in relation to the Scheduled Caste specification by considering it as a smaller caste group within the bigger caste group of Sunirs. The court reasoned that the appellant claimed to be a member of the Saha caste, which was a smaller caste group within the Sunris and, therefore, did not belong to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40. The Election Tribunal, as well as the High Court, accepted this interpretation of the term ""Saha"" in relation to the Scheduled Caste specification."
19,"Why did the Supreme Court ultimately decide to allow Appeal No. 931 of 1965 and dismiss Appeal No. 1149 of 1965, and what were the findings regarding the appellant's caste status?","The Supreme Court allowed Appeal No. 931 of 1965 and dismissed Appeal No. 1149 of 1965 because it found that the appellant, Abhoy Pada Saha, was correctly classified as belonging to the Scheduled Caste specified in item 40 of the President's Order. The court concluded that the term ""Saha"" in item 40 referred to a smaller caste group within the Sunri caste and not a distinct or separate caste. The evidence presented did not establish that Saha was an independent caste, and it was not proven that Abhoy Pada belonged to a different caste group than the Sunri. Therefore, the Supreme Court restored the Election Tribunal's decision, dismissing the petition challenging the validity of the election. The dismissal of Appeal No. 1149 followed because Sudhir Kumar Mondal's request to be declared elected in place of Abhoy Pada Saha was not upheld.","The Supreme Court ultimately decided to allow Appeal No. 931 of 1965 and dismiss Appeal No. 1149 of 1965 because Abhoy Pada Saha, the appellant in Appeal No. 931 of 1965, was found to have falsely described himself as a member of the Sunri caste which is a Scheduled Caste on the nomination paper. Sudhir Kumar Mondal, the respondent in Appeal No. 931 of 1965, was admittedly a member of a Scheduled Caste. Therefore, the Court found that Abhoy Pada Saha's false claim regarding his caste status was misleading and invalid, leading to the dismissal of his appeal. Sudhir Kumar Mondal's status as a member of a Scheduled Caste was upheld, resulting in the allowance of his appeal."
20,What was the primary reason the High Court dismissed the petition filed by the appellants regarding the election process in Raipur?,"The High Court dismissed the petition because the appellants did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay in filing the petition. The Court found that the petitioners were aware of the defect in the notice as early as October 1978 but waited until December 28, 1978, just three days before the scheduled poll, to file their petition. This delay led the High Court to exercise its discretion to reject the petition due to the inordinate delay, which would lead to public inconvenience and interfere with the rights of others.","The High Court dismissed the petition filed by the appellants regarding the election process in Raipur because the petition was heard and it was dismissed by a Division Bench of the High Court on January 20, 1979."
21,"What was the defect in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Rules, 1963, and how did it affect the election process?","The defect in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) was that it incorrectly stated that claims and objections to the electoral roll should be preferred within a period of 20 days from the date of the publication of the notice, instead of the prescribed 30 days as per Rule 4(3). This incorrect shorter period allegedly prevented a large number of people from filing claims and objections within the correct timeframe, potentially vitiating the entire election process. However, the Court found that the petitioners did not take timely action to correct this defect, which contributed to the dismissal of their petition.","The defect in the notice issued under Rule 4(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Rules, 1963 was not specifically mentioned in the context. However, it can be inferred that the defect may have been related to the irregularity in the division of Raipur town into different wards for purposes of election. This defect may have affected the election process by potentially causing confusion or unfairness in the distribution of voters across the different wards, thereby impacting the outcome of the election."
22,What were the main grounds of detention mentioned in the order against Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza by the Government of Bombay?,"The grounds of detention against Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza included:

He was carrying on espionage on behalf of the Portuguese Government with financial help from the Portuguese authorities, assisted by underground workers.
He was collecting intelligence about the security arrangements on the border area and making such intelligence available to the Portuguese authorities.
These activities were aimed at causing further deterioration in the relations between the Portuguese Government and the Indian Government over the Goan National Movement, which were considered prejudicial to the security of India and to India's relations with Portugal.","The main grounds of detention mentioned in the order against Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza by the Government of Bombay were:
- Carrying out espionage on behalf of the Portuguese Government with the financial help given by the Portuguese authorities.
- Collecting intelligence about security arrangements on the border area.
- Making intelligence available to the Portuguese authorities."
23,"What were the primary contentions raised by the appellant, Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza, against his detention order?","Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza raised the following primary contentions against his detention order:

The detention order was mala fide, passed with the ulterior motive of preventing his freedom of speech and professional activities concerning Goan affairs.
The detaining authority failed to apply its mind to the legitimate objects of detention.
The grounds of detention were vague.
The state's claim that no particulars of the grounds could be furnished in the public interest was unsustainable and mala fide.
These contentions were presented to argue that the detention order was not made in good faith and lacked proper justification.","The primary contentions raised by the appellant, Lawrence Joachim Joseph DeSouza, against his detention order were:
1. The order of detention was made without any real application of mind by the detaining authority.
2. The authority acted merely at the instance of the police who were in league with the Goan Action Committee.
3. The police procured the detention order for the purpose of suppressing the freedom of the appellant, to ventilate his point of view on Goan politics, and to take up professionally the cause of persons in the position of Carlos."
24,What was the primary issue in the appeal against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court?,The primary issue in the appeal was whether the Amauli properties acquired by Mahant Shivshankar Yati were personal properties or whether they belonged to the Math Sauna or the deity Sri Thakur Gokarneshwar Mahadeo Ji.,The primary issue in the appeal against the judgment of the Allahabad High Court was whether the High Court was correct in upholding the decision of the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission to re-hold the recruitment examination.
25,"What did the High Court conclude regarding the ownership of the Amauli properties, and how did this conclusion impact the appeal?","The High Court concluded that the Amauli properties were personal properties of Mahant Shivshankar Yati, not belonging to the Math Sauna or the deity. This conclusion was based on the finding that the fund used to purchase the Amauli properties was the personal property of Mahant Shivpher Yati, which devolved to Shivshankar Yati. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, affirming that the Amauli properties did not form part of the Math Sauna's or deity's properties.","The High Court concluded that the Amauli properties were purchased by Shivshanker Yati in 1921 from his personal and separate funds inherited from his predecessor, Shivpher Yati. Therefore, the Amauli properties were regarded as his personal and separate properties and did not belong to the Math or the deity. This conclusion impacted the appeal as it led to the dismissal of the appeal, with the High Court stating that the Amauli properties constituted the personal property of Uma Shankar Yati and did not form part of the properties of the Math Sauna or the deity, Sri Thakur, Gokarneshwar Mahadeoji."
26,What were the primary grounds for the acquittal of Prakash (accused 5) in the appeals heard by the Supreme Court?,"Prakash (accused 5) was acquitted primarily because his conviction for conspiracy under section 302 read with section 120B I.P.C. was deemed unsustainable. The Supreme Court found a technical flaw in the conviction of a single accused for conspiracy, as at least two persons are required for an offence of conspiracy under section 120A I.P.C. Additionally, since accused 5 was not a party to the specific charge related to the murder of Malan (charge No. 4), and there were no appeals filed against the acquittal of accused 1 and 6 for conspiracy, his conviction could not be upheld.","The primary grounds for the acquittal of Prakash (accused 5) in the appeals heard by the Supreme Court were insufficient evidence against him proving his guilt in respect of the charge framed regarding the murder of Malan beyond all reasonable doubt. The court found that there was not enough evidence to convict Prakash and therefore acquitted him, setting aside his conviction and the sentence awarded to him."
27,What evidence led to the confirmation of Vinayak's (accused 6) conviction for the murder of Malan?,"Vinayak's (accused 6) conviction was confirmed based on several pieces of evidence:

Recovery of a Razor Blade: A razor blade stained with blood of group B, matching that of the victim Malan, was recovered following a confessional statement by accused 6.
Medical Evidence: The autopsy of Malan revealed multiple incised wounds and injuries consistent with sharp cutting weapons, supporting the claim of a violent murder.
Confession and Witness Testimony: The approver P.W. 1’s testimony and the retracted judicial confession of accused 6, corroborated by the recovered razor blade and medical evidence, proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused 6 was involved in the murder of Malan.","The evidence that led to the confirmation of Vinayak's (accused 6) conviction for the murder of Malan included the recovery of a razor blade stained with human blood of group B, which matched that of Malan. This razor blade was found based on Vinayak's confessional statement admitted under section 27 of the Evidence Act. Additionally, a blood-stained shirt of accused 6 was recovered from his house. There was also evidence indicating Vinayak's presence near the scene of the crime before and after the murder, as witnessed by Shivram and Abasaheb. Finally, there was a retracted judicial confession by accused 6 that further incriminated him in the murder of Malan."
28,"Why was the appellant, who was promoted to the post of Head Clerk on an ad hoc basis in January 1974 and appointed to the post on April 1, 1975, absorbed as a clerk instead of a Head Clerk?","The appellant was absorbed as a clerk instead of a Head Clerk because the Panchayat Samiti, which promoted him, lost its power to make appointments after June 13, 1973, due to the deletion of section 33 of the Punjab Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads Act, 1961 by the Amending Act of 1973. The Panchayat Samiti no longer had the authority to appoint him to the Head Clerk position after this date. Therefore, despite his promotion, the Government was not obligated to absorb him as a Head Clerk, and he was lawfully absorbed in the post of a Clerk.","The appellant was absorbed as a clerk instead of a Head Clerk because his appointment as a Head Clerk prior to his absorption in Government service was not recognized and protected. The Panchayat Samiti did not have the right to appoint him to the post of Head Clerk on the date on which it purported to do so, as this right was fortified on June 13, 1973. Therefore, the appellant's appointment as a Head Clerk in January 1974 on an ad hoc basis and in April 1975 on a regular basis was without the authority of law. As a result, the Government was not bound to absorb him in the post of a Head Clerk and instead lawfully absorbed him in the post of a Clerk."
29,What did the Court decide regarding the appellant's claim to be absorbed as a Head Clerk?,"The Court decided that the appellant's claim to be absorbed as a Head Clerk was without merit. Since the Panchayat Samiti's power to make appointments was revoked on June 13, 1973, any appointments to the Head Clerk position made after this date were unauthorized. Therefore, the appellant's promotion to Head Clerk after this date did not entitle him to be absorbed in that position. The Court upheld the absorption of the appellant as a Clerk, in accordance with the terms of his original employment.","The Court decided that the appellant's claim to be absorbed as a Head Clerk was not valid. The Court stated that the appellant was appointed lawfully to the post of a Clerk, and that is the post in which the Government has absorbed him. The appointment of the appellant to the post of a Head Clerk was deemed to be without the authority of law, so the Government was not bound to absorb him in that position. The appeal was dismissed, and there was no order as to costs."
30,"Why did the Andhra Pradesh High Court strike down Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968?","The Andhra Pradesh High Court struck down Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 on the grounds that it suffered from excessive delegation of legislative power. The Court found that Section 28 conferred an arbitrary and uncanalised power upon the Administrator by not providing any criteria or guidelines for exercising discretion. This, according to the High Court, left licensed dealers at the mercy of the Administrator when seeking permission to carry on money lending or banking business on the security of gold articles, leading to potential arbitrary decisions. The High Court's reasoning was that the lack of explicit rules or criteria and the absence of a requirement for the Administrator to provide reasons for decisions rendered the section unconstitutional.","The Andhra Pradesh High Court struck down Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 because the challenge to the validity of this particular section by the Union of India was successful."
31,"On what grounds did the Supreme Court uphold the validity of Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968?","The Supreme Court upheld the validity of Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 by rejecting the High Court’s reasoning of excessive delegation of power. The Supreme Court noted that although Section 28 did not specify express rules or guidelines, the overall scheme and objectives of the Gold Control Act provided sufficient guidance to the Administrator. The Court emphasized that the restrictions imposed by Section 28 were meant to prevent the circumvention of other provisions of the Act and that the Administrator's discretion was to be exercised within the framework of the Act’s objectives. Furthermore, the Supreme Court pointed out that the Administrator’s decisions were subject to revision by the Central Government, ensuring accountability. Thus, Section 28 was not deemed to confer arbitrary or uncanalised power.","The Supreme Court upheld the validity of Section 28 of the Gold Control Act, 1968 on the grounds that it is part of the entire scheme of Gold Control as envisaged by the Act. The Court stated that the object of the enactment and the scheme provide sufficient guidance to the Administrator in the matter of exercising his discretion under that section. The main object of putting the Act on the Statute Book, as indicated by its long title, is ""to provide, in the economic and financial interests of the community, for the control of the production, manufacture, supply, distribution, use and possession of, and business in, gold ornaments and articles of gold and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto."""
32,What is the main legal issue addressed in Special Leave Petition (CRL.) No. 1765 of 1987?,"The main legal issue addressed in Special Leave Petition (CRL.) No. 1765 of 1987 revolves around the interpretation of section 630 of the Companies Act, specifically the scope and effect of sub-section (1) of this section. The controversy concerns the meaning of the terms ""officer or employee"" and ""any such property"" within this section, and whether these terms include both current and past officers and employees of a company. The case discusses conflicting interpretations by the High Courts of Calcutta and Bombay.","The main legal issue addressed in Special Leave Petition (CRL.) No. 1765 of 1987 is related to the provision contained in sub-section 11 A of the Land Acquisition Act. This provision, along with the stay orders obtained by the petitioners, was considered highly material in the determination of the Special Leave Petitions. The fact that there was no reference to the stay orders in the Special Leave Petitions, and that the respondents only became aware of these orders when they appeared in response to the notice and filed their counter affidavit, was noted as a curious point."
33,What was the outcome of the special leave petition and which court's interpretation was favored?,"The outcome of the special leave petition was that it was dismissed, and the interpretation favored was that of the Bombay High Court. The court upheld that the term ""officer or employee"" in section 630(1) includes both current and past officers and employees of a company. This interpretation supports a broad and liberal construction of the provision to further the object and purpose of the legislation, contrasting with the narrow interpretation by the Calcutta High Court which limited it to only current officers and employees.","The outcome of the special leave petition was in favor of the petitioners, as they obtained an interim stay of dispossession. The interpretation favored was that of the High Court of Bombay, as it had been the consistent view taken in a series of cases."

Consequently, the High Court declared that the demands made by the Deputy Labour Commissioner for All India Reporter Limited to comply with the orders based on the recommendations of the Palekar Tribunal were unsustainable. This decision was challenged and led to the appeal in Civil Appeal No. 8440 of 1983.",The High Court of Bombay accepted the plea of the Ist respondent and declared that the law reports were not newspapers within the meaning of section 2(b) of the Act.
36,What was the primary legal issue in the appeal No. 1367 of 1980?,"The primary legal issue in the appeal No. 1367 of 1980 was whether the Board of Revenue for Rajasthan had the jurisdiction to set aside the orders of the Sub Divisional Officer and the Revenue Appellate Authority when no appeal or revision was filed by the State against the Sub Divisional Officer's order dated 5th May, 1976, particularly concerning the determination of the ceiling area for Raghubir Singh under the Rajasthan Tenancy Act (Act No. 3 of 1955).","The primary legal issue in the appeal No. 1367 of 1980 was whether the appellant was a licensee or a tenant, and incidentally, whether the Court of Small Causes, Bombay had jurisdiction to deal with the eviction petition in the case."

38,What were the main points of the appellant's defense in Criminal Appeal No. 8 of 1951?,"The appellant, W.H. King, defended himself by stating that he was seeking a partner to carry on his business during his intended absence, who would also act as the caretaker of his flat. He claimed that the sum of Rs. 29,500 was not a ""pugree"" (a key money or lease premium) but represented capital for a share in the business. Additionally, the Rs. 2,000 paid by the complainant was intended as a guarantee against disposal and damage to the furniture, which was to be refunded upon the appellant's return to India. His wife, who was charged with aiding and abetting, denied any involvement.","The main points of the appellant's defense in Criminal Appeal No. 8 of 1951 were related to the fact that he was carrying on a business in Bombay under the name and style of Associated Commercial Enterprises and was the tenant of a flat on the second floor of a building called ""Ganga Vihar"", Marine Drive, Bombay, which belongs to a lady named Durgeshwari Devi. Additionally, the defense also included the argument that the appellant was falsely implicated in a murder case (Crime No. 331 of 1985) and was not at all concerned with the murder. Furthermore, it was mentioned that at the time the order was served, the appellant had already surrendered in respect of the criminal charge against him and was undertrial in the said criminal case."
39,"Why was the appellant's conviction under section 19(2) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 set aside by the Court?","The appellant's conviction under section 19(2) of the Act was set aside because the Court found that there was no ""relinquishment"" of tenancy as required by section 19(1). The document (Exhibit D) that the appellant used to hand over possession of the flat constituted an assignment of tenancy rather than a relinquishment. The Court noted that relinquishment involves giving up rights and possession to the landlord or someone holding the landlord's interest, which was not the case here. As the statute requires strict interpretation, the Court concluded that no offence under section 19(1) had occurred, and therefore, the conviction under section 19(2) could not be sustained.","The appellant's conviction under section 19(2) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 was set aside by the Court because the Court found that there was no evidence provided in the context to prove that the appellant received the sum of Rs. 29,500 as a condition for the relinquishment of his tenancy."
